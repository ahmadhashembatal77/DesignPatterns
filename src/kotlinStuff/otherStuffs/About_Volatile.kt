/**
 * Purpose and Behavior:
 * The @Volatile annotation is used to control the memory visibility of variables in multi-threaded scenarios.
 *
 * When applied to a property, it marks the JVM backing field of that property as volatile.
 *
 * Volatile properties ensure that writes to the field are immediately visible to other threads,
 * and reads always see the latest changes.
 *
 * In essence, @Volatile serves the same purpose as Javaâ€™s volatile keyword.
 * */
